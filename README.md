# The queue system


### This project was built for an online ticket system for companies that gets a lot of clients each day. The system makes the possibility to select the date and time for the appointment. It is strongly considered already booked date and time, so the company could be confident about careful queue assignment.

# Built with

- React JS with functional components
- Firebase, for auth and storage
- Used [Ant Design](https://ant.design/) for design
- Netlify, for deployment

# The [Demo Live](https://silver-heliotrope-a092a0.netlify.app) version is available
